## 4. Sensor Variance Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Mean | 12.8060 |
| Std | 4.9639 |
| CV | 0.388 |
| Range | [7.8421, 17.7698] |

---

## 5. Algorithm Recommendations

| Algorithm | Recommendation | Priority | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| FedAvg | Recommended | 1 | Low heterogeneity makes FedAvg a good choice |
| FedProx | Recommended | 2 | Proximal term helps with moderate heterogeneity (CV=0.18) |
| SCAFFOLD | Optional | 3 | Overhead may not be justified for low heterogeneity |
| FedDC | Optional | 4 | Consider if SCAFFOLD doesn't meet performance targets |

## 6. Conclusion

### Heterogeneity Classification: **MODERATE**

Noticeable but manageable heterogeneity exists. FedAvg should work but FedProx may improve stability. Consider partial participation experiments to test robustness.

### Recommended Experimental Protocol

1. **Baseline:** Run FedAvg to establish baseline performance
2. **Primary:** Run FedProx for moderate improvement
3. **Comparison:** Test across participation rates (100%, 70%, 50%)
4. **Validation:** Use held-out test data for final evaluation
