**Phase:** 6B - FedDC Conditional Algorithm Extension

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Decision: ✓ **PROMOTE**

**Reason:** FedDC outperforms SCAFFOLD on FD002/FD004 with no regression on FD001

---

## 2. Dataset-by-Dataset Comparison

| Dataset | SCAFFOLD RMSE | FedDC RMSE | Improvement | Time Overhead | FedDC Better? |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| FD001 | 11.61 | 11.93 | -2.7% | -13.2% | ✗ |
| FD002 | 41.16 | 33.66 | +18.2% | +3.0% | ✓ |
| FD004 | 60.44 | 57.81 | +4.4% | -2.3% | ✓ |


---

## 3. Overall Comparison

- **Average SCAFFOLD Test RMSE:** 37.74
- **Average FedDC Test RMSE:** 34.47
- **Overall Improvement:** +8.7%

---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria Check

| Criterion | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| FedDC outperforms SCAFFOLD on FD002 | ✓ | +18.2% improvement |
| FedDC outperforms SCAFFOLD on FD004 | ✓ | +4.4% improvement |
| No regression on FD001 | ✓ | -2.7% change |


---

## 5. Recommendation

### ✓ **PROMOTE FedDC to Phase 6C**

FedDC has demonstrated significant improvement over SCAFFOLD on the challenging FD002 and FD004 datasets
while maintaining performance on FD001. Include FedDC in full-scale experiments.


---

## 6. Next Steps

1. Include FedDC in Phase 6C full-scale experiments
2. Test FedDC with full client count (100/248/260)
3. Evaluate partial participation robustness
